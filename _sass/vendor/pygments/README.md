The files in this folder are sourced from:
[GitHub: jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes)

If you would like to use these files in your own project, please source them
from there for the latest version.

A neat tool that shows previews of these themes is also available here:
[Jekyll Pygments Theme Previews](http://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes)

A mirror of these files is available at my local fork:
