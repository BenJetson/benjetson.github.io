## How It's Made

The site is built upon modern web technologies, built upon software from these
awesome open source projects:

- [**Jekyll**](https://www.jekyllrb.com) – static site builder
- [**Liquid**](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) – templating engine
- [**Bootstrap 4**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5) – interface framework
- [**PrefixFree**](https://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree) – client side CSS
  vendor prefixing

The site is powered by these services:

- [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com) – hosting provider
- [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) – continuous
  integration
