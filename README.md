## Welcome

This repository is in a bit of a transition state right now because I am
migrating the framework and hosting for this site.

This is a major overhaul, all new code is on the way!

| Category  | Old                                      | New                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Framework | [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)           | [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) |
| Hosting   | [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) | [Vercel](https://vercel.com)  |

## Structure

In the meantime, all old code from the Jekyll site will be in the
[`jekyll` directory](./jekyll) and the new code for the Next.js site will be in
the [`next` directory](./next).

The idea here is some pieces, like post content markdown files, can be moved
over. For the pieces that will be eventually deleted, this just lets me view
them easily in parallel without them conflicting with each other.

Eventually, the `jekyll` folder will be destroyed and the contents of the `next`
folder will live here at the repo root. Someday. ðŸ™‚
