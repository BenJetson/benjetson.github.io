This is a demonstration post for the purpose of testing the site layout for
blog posts. There really isn't any valuable content here.

First, let's see how headings look!

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

Now for some _italic text_ followed by **bold text** followed by **_bold italic
text_** followed by ~~striked text~~ and finally a [hyperlink](#nowhere).

Interestingly[^1] this text has footnotes[^2].

---

[^1]: This is the contents of the footnote.
[^2]: While these footnotes are in the center of the text, they appear only at the bottom of the page.

This is an unordered list:

- item
  - subitem
  - subitem
  - subitem
- item
- really inexplicably long list item that takes up a lot of space, possibly more
  than one line when rendered even, who knows what is possible depending on the
  viewport size!
- item
- item

This is an ordered list:

1. one
1. two
1. three
   a. three a
   a. three b
   a. three c
1. four
1. five
1. six

This is a checklist.

- [ ] Do this
- [x] Did this
- [ ] Do that
- [ ] really inexplicably long list item that takes up a lot of space, possibly
      more than one line when rendered even, who knows what is possible
      depending on the viewport size!
- [x] Did that

This is a table:

| App Name  | Developer     | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Safari    | Apple Inc     | Browse the internet with energy efficiency.      |
| 1Password | AgileBits Inc | Go ahead, forget all of your passwords!          |
| Xcode     | Apple Inc     | Develop software for Apple platforms and beyond. |
| GIMP      | GNOME Project | Edit images with the power of open source.       |

This is a SMALL image.

This is a LARGE image.

And some math for good measure.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
